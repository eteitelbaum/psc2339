Fiscal discipline\n2.  Public expenditure priorities (investment vs consumption)\n3.  Tax reform (broader base, lower marginal rates)\n4.  Financial liberalization\n5.  Competitive exchange rates\n6.  Trade liberalization\n7.  Foreign direct investment (remove barriers)\n8.  Privatization of state-owned enterprises\n9.  Deregulation of markets\n10. Secure property rights\n\n## Reform Elements \n\n-   Stabilization\n    -   Fiscal discipline, inflation control, exchange rate policy\n-   Liberalization / opening markets\n    -   Trade, finance, FDI, deregulation\n-   State restructuring\n    -   Privatization, public spending reprioritization, tax reform\n-   Longer-run institutional reform\n    -   Property rights, regulatory capacity, state capability\n\n# Crisis and Reform\n\n## Why Crisis Creates Reform Windows\n\n-   Recession, inflation, shortages, and debt make the status quo\n    politically costly\n-   Balance of payments crises create immediate external financing\n    pressure\n-   International lenders often condition support on reform packages\n-   Reformers frame crisis as proof that \"the old model\" has failed\n\n## Elements of an Economic Crisis\n\n<br>\n\n-   Recession / unemployment\n-   Inflation (sometimes hyperinflation)\n-   Balance of payments crisis\n-   Debt crisis\n-   Financial crisis / banking instability\n\n## \n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### Eastern Europe\n\n- Collapse of communist systems\n- Price distortions, shortages, inflation\n- Push for rapid transition to market economies\n- Big external role for international experts / IFIs\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### India (1991)\n\n- Balance of payments crisis\n- Trade shock after Soviet collapse\n- Oil shock from Gulf War\n- Capital flight and currency pressure\n- Reform under crisis, but without full system collapse\n:::\n:::\n\n# Reform Packages\n\n## Reform #1: Stabilization\n\n-   Goal: stop inflation / currency crisis from spiraling\n-   Typical tools\n    -   Cut or restrain public spending\n    -   Raise revenue / taxes\n    -   Devalue currency\n    -   Tighten monetary policy\n-   Political problem: immediate pain, delayed gains\n\n## Reform #2: Liberalization\n\n<br>\n\n-   End controls (prices, licenses, quotas, reservations)\n-   Reduce tariffs and trade barriers\n-   Expand FDI access\n-   Financial sector reforms\n-   Logic: competition, investment, innovation, and export growth\n\n## Reform #3 Privatization \n\n<br>\n\n-   Transfer state assets to private actors\n-   Improve incentives and efficiency (in theory)\n-   Raise state revenue\n\n## Reform #4 Structural adjustment\n\n<br>\n\n-   Longer-term restructuring of how the economy is governed\n-   Labor, land, capital markets; industrial and investment policy\n-   Core debate: market reform without state capacity can backfire\n\n# Shock Therapy vs. Gradualism\n\n## \n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### Shock Therapy\n\n-   Rapid, broad reforms\n-   Front-load stabilization and liberalization\n-   Goal: break old system quickly\n-   Commonly associated with Eastern Europe\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n### Gradualism\n\n-   Sequenced reforms over time\n-   Build institutions while opening markets\n-   Slower on politically costly reforms\n-   India is a key example\n:::\n:::\n\n## India vs. Eastern Europe (Sequencing)\n\n-   India moved relatively quickly on trade / investment liberalization\n-   India moved more slowly on privatization and labor reform\n-   Eastern Europe often attempted broader reforms much faster\n-   Key question for us:\n    -   When does speed solve problems?\n    -   When does speed outpace institutions?\n\n## Risk: \"Partial Reform Equilibrium\"\n\n<br>\n\n-   Early winners from reform may block later reforms\n-   Privatization without strong institutions can create asset capture\n-   Result can be a hybrid system:\n    -   Neither effective markets nor accountable states\n-   This is one reason \"reform\" outcomes vary so much\n\n# Outcomes and Debate\n\n## Growth Rates in India and China\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lecture-7.1_files/figure-revealjs/growth_graph-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## What Growth Rates Tell Us\n\n<br>\n\n-   Shows growth performance over time (and volatility)\n-   Does not tell us by itself:\n    -   Which reforms caused growth\n    -   Who benefited\n    -   What social costs occurred during transition\n-   This is why we need comparative and historical analysis\n\n# Legacies of Reform \n\n## Reading Focus (Archibong et al.)\n\n<br>\n\n-   Reading for today:\n    [Washington Consensus Reforms and Lessons for Economic Performance in\n    sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Washington-Consensus-Reforms.pdf)\n-   Main question:\n    -   What were the long-run effects and limits of Washington\n        Consensus-style reforms in Africa?\n-   Working distinction:\n    -   Reform adoption is not the same as reform success\n\n## Discussion Questions (Small Groups)\n\n-   What is the authors' main argument about the legacy of reforms in\n    Africa?\n-   Which reforms seem most important in their account, and why?\n-   What role do state capacity and political institutions play?\n-   How do the authors treat short-run pain vs. long-run gains?\n-   What are the limits of the evidence (quantitative and case-based)?\n\n## Group Report-Out\n\n<br>\n\n-   Each group: one claim from the reading the class should take\n    seriously\n-   Each group: one claim you are skeptical about (and why)\n-   Connect back to today:\n    -   Does your evidence support shock therapy, gradualism, or \"it\n        depends\"?\n\n# Contemporary Application\n\n## Lebanon: Crisis and Reform in Practice\n\n-   [When robbing a bank seems perfectly justified](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/opinion/lebanon-crisis-economy-bank-robbers.html)\n-   Ongoing recovery / reform context:\n    [World Bank on Lebanon](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/lebanon/overview#1)\n-   Use Lebanon as an application exercise:\n    -   Crisis diagnosis\n    -   Reform package design\n    -   Political feasibility\n\n## Lebanon Discussion {.smaller}\n\n<br>\n\n-   Is Lebanon's crisis mainly a macroeconomic crisis, a banking /\n    financial crisis, a governance crisis, or all three?\n-   Which Washington Consensus-style reforms might help in Lebanon?\n-   Which reforms could deepen social pain without protections?\n-   What sequencing would you propose:\n    -   Stabilization first?\n    -   Institutional repair first?\n    -   Both in parallel?\n\n\n",
