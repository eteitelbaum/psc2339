# Women in the Apparel Sector

## Apparel Sector in Low-Income Countries

- Women making up the majority of the workforce in apparel
- Employment is concentrated in low-income countries in Asia and Latin America
- Workers often face exploitative working conditions, including long hours and unsafe environments
- Wages are typically below living wage standards, trapping workers in cycles of poverty
- The sector's reliance on low-cost labor perpetuates gender inequality and exploitation

## Voluntary Compliance

- A system where companies self-regulate adherence to labor and environmental standards without legal enforcement
- Relies on corporate codes of conduct and industry standards rather than government regulations
- Third-party audits are often used to assess compliance
- Designed to promote ethical practices but participation is generally optional for companies

## Problems with Voluntary Compliance 

- Critics argue it lacks accountability and often fails to protect vulnerable workers effectively
- Vulnerabilities have been pushed down to more informal and unregulated suppliers outside of the formal supply chain
- Generally private governance initiatives ignore freedom of association and collective bargaining rights
- Worker empowerment is crucial, but must be pursued within an unequal economic context

## Global Framework Agreements

  - Not legally binding
  - Expired after five years, not renewed
- Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh
  - Mostly European companies 
  - Legally binding
  - Renewed after 5 years but undermined by garment manufacturers in Bangladesh

## Trade Unions

<br>

- Trade unions in developing countries male-dominated
- Tied to political parties
- INGOs undemocratic, lack connection to workers
