# Overview

## Polanyi's Obejctives

-   Explain rise of fascism, political instability and war
-   Advance an argument about negative effects of economic liberalism
-   Provide an alternative vision of the economy's place in society
-   Defend market regulation as not inherently "leftist"

:::

# The Self-Regulating Market

## The "Invisible Hand"

-   19th century economic liberalism
    -   Ricardo/Smith
-   An economy directed by market prices and nothing but market prices
-   Polanyi calls it a "dangerous fantasy"
-   Tremendous amount of bureaucracy/governance required to maintain
    free markets

## State of Nature I

-   For Smith, our nature is to "truck, barter and trade"
-   For Polanyi, we are communal by nature
-   Markets have always played some role in society but not the dominant
    role
-   Importance of ethnography
    -   Evidence-based approach
    -   Not just a rhetorical device

## State of Nature II

-   Trobriand Islanders (Papua New Guinea)
-   People motivated by status more than money
    -   Money is a means to and end
-   Money not that relevant for distribution
    -   Reciprocity
    -   Redistribution
    -   Householding

## Debate: The State of Nature

-   **Choose a side**: Are humans naturally self-interested traders (Smith) or communal cooperators (Polanyi)?
-   **Small groups**: Discuss your position and prepare arguments
    -   Smith camp: Find evidence from your own experience/observations
    -   Polanyi camp: Find counter-examples to the "truck, barter, trade" view
-   **Class debate**: Each side presents their strongest argument

## The Submerged Economy

-   Historically, the economy was "submerged" in social relationships
-   People acted to safeguard social standing, not individual material gain
-   Markets existed but were not dominant
-   The market economy "disembedded" the economy from society
    -   Made the economy autonomous
    -   Subordinated society to economic logic

## Three Forms of Integration

-   **Reciprocity**: exchanges based on mutual obligation
    -   Institutional pattern: symmetry (kinship groups, tribal societies)
-   **Redistribution**: centralized collection and distribution
    -   Institutional pattern: centricity (chiefdoms, ancient empires)
-   **Householding**: production for one's own use
    -   Institutional pattern: autarky (self-sufficiency)
-   **Market exchange**: controlled by prices (unprecedented dominance)

## The Unprecedented Market System

-   A system controlled by markets is "entirely unprecedented"
-   Gain and profit never played an important role in human economy
-   Aristotle distinguished:
    -   *Oeconomia*: managing the household
    -   *Chrematistics*: money-making for gain (unnatural)
-   The 19th century inverted this hierarchy

# The Fictional Commodities

## Three Elements Treated as Commodities

-   For a self-regulating market to function, three things must be bought and sold:
    -   **Labor**: man under the name of labor
    -   **Land**: nature under the name of land  
    -   **Money**: purchasing power/capitalist organization itself
-   But none are actually produced for sale
-   Polanyi calls this the "commodity fiction"

## Why They Are "Fictional"

-   **Commodities** are produced to be sold on the market
-   **Labor** is human activity, inseparable from life itself
    -   Cannot be stored, moved around freely like goods
-   **Land** is nature, not produced by humans
    -   Includes natural resources, environment
-   **Money** is a token of purchasing power
    -   Created by banking/government, not produced for sale

## The Danger of the Commodity Fiction {.smaller}

<br>

-   Treating these as "real" commodities is socially destructive
-   **Labor**: Reducing humans to commodities destroys social bonds
    -   Unemployment = human beings without purpose or livelihood
-   **Land**: Treating nature as commodity leads to environmental degradation
-   **Money**: Unregulated money supply causes financial instability
-   Leaving their "fate to the market would be tantamount to annihilating them"

# The "Double Movement"

## Description of Double Movement

-   Movement: expansion of liberalism and self-regulating markets
-   Counter-movement: reaction of society against dislocation caused by
    markets
-   New regulations emerged to protect the fictional commodities
    -   Shelter land, labor and money from market forces
    -   Protect society from "devastating effects" of commodification
    -   Importance of class dynamics: winners and losers

## Who are the Opponents of Liberalism?

-   Not a unified, hegemonic left or an anti-liberal ideology
-   Responses are rather piecemeal
    -   Regulation arises in many areas
    -   Across many countries
    -   In response to similar problems
-   Regulation is a result of liberalism's failure, not its cause

## Small Groups

-   Think of a modern application of the Double Movement
-   One person argues in favor of a market expansion
-   A second provides a potential regulatory response
-   Others represent interests of people and factors affected by the expansion (winners and losers)
    -   Can be workers, capitalists, environment, ect.
-   Can there be a "winner" in this debate?

# The Birth of Liberalism

## Elements of Liberalism

-   Unfettered labor market
    -   Cheap labor for industry
-   Gold standard
    -   Facilitated trade
    -   Kept prices in check
-   Free trade
    -   Industrialists/traders wanted to access raw materials
    -   Facilitated by the gold standard

::: notes
Liberalism was adopted to suit needs of industry and instability in the
international economy Needs: price stability, cheap labor, raw materials
:::

## The Gold Standard: Origins

-   **Origins (1821-1870s)**: UK first adopted it (1821), followed by other major economies
-   **Purpose**: Pegging currency value to gold
    -   Ensured monetary stability and prevented inflation
    -   Facilitated international trade
-   **Classical Gold Standard (1870s–1914)**: Stable but rigid
-   Part of the liberal project to create self-regulating markets

## The Gold Standard: A Fictional Commodity

-   Remember: money is a fictional commodity
    -   Not produced for sale
    -   A token of purchasing power created by government/banks
-   The gold standard attempted to make money "self-regulating"
    -   Remove government discretion over money supply
    -   Let market forces automatically adjust prices and trade
-   But this created severe economic and social problems

## The Gold Standard's Problems

-   **Deflationary**: Could not print money in excess of gold supply
-   **Boom-bust cycles**: Limited government response to economic crises
-   **Trade imbalances**: Countries lost gold, forced into austerity
-   Economic liberalism created political instability

## The Gold Standard's Decline

-   **WWI & Interwar Period (1914–1930s)**: Suspension during war, economic instability, deflation
-   **Bretton Woods (1944–1971)**: USD pegged to gold; other currencies pegged to USD
-   **1971**: Nixon ends Bretton Woods (gold peg unsustainable)
-   **Legacy**: No country uses it today
-   Society protected itself from the money commodity fiction

::: notes
The gold standard was problematic because it prevented the government
from undertaking monetary policy to counteract economic downturns
:::

## Where Did Liberalism Come From?

-   Does not date back to Smith or Ricardo
-   These thinkers were ahead of their time
-   Emerged out of class politics following industrial revolution

::: notes
Liberalism is a relatively recent ideology/practice
:::

## The Paradox: Laissez-Faire Was Planned

-   Free markets did not emerge naturally
-   Required deliberate, organized political intervention
-   Creating "free" markets demanded massive state action
    -   Factory Acts
    -   Poor Laws
    -   Enclosure Acts
-   Irony: laissez-faire required extensive government planning

## The Benthamite State

-   Creating free markets **increased** need for administration
-   Required enormous bureaucratic apparatus:
    -   Factory inspectors
    -   Poor law administration  
    -   Labor market regulation
    -   Enforcement of contracts
-   "Laissez-faire was not a natural process but an artificial achievement"

## Spontaneous vs. Planned

-   **The market**: Deliberately planned and imposed from above
    -   Required legislation, coercion, state power
-   **Protective regulations**: Spontaneous, unplanned reaction
    -   Emerged pragmatically across different countries
    -   Different ideologies, same protective response
-   Reverses the liberal narrative

## The Liberal Defense

-   Economic liberals blame market failure on "interference"
    -   Trade unions restricted labor markets
    -   Social legislation distorted prices
    -   Protectionist tariffs prevented adjustment
-   Claim: the self-regulating market would have worked if left alone

## Polanyi's Rebuttal {.smaller}

<br>

-   Protective measures arose **everywhere** regardless of ideology:
    -   Prussia (conservative)
    -   England (liberal)
    -   France (revolutionary)
-   This proves regulations were a necessary response to market perils
-   The "economistic fallacy": blaming social protection for market failures
-   Society protected itself because the market system was unsustainable

# The Path to Fascism

## Institutional Strain

-   Two organizing principles in conflict:
    -   **Economic liberalism**: Demands self-regulating markets
    -   **Social protection**: Demands shelter from market forces
-   Both became "sectional weapons" in class struggle:
    -   Working class used the state for protection
    -   Trading/industrial classes used economic power
-   Created a dangerous political deadlock

## The Perilous Deadlock

-   Cannot have both full market freedom and social protection
-   Each class able to block the other
-   Democratic institutions paralyzed by irreconcilable demands
-   Market economy vs. social stability: an impossible tension

## The Fascist "Solution"

-   Fascism emerged as authoritarian response to this impasse
-   Promised to:
    -   Maintain capitalist economy
    -   Provide social stability and protection  
    -   Suppress working-class demands through force
-   Eliminated democratic deadlock by eliminating democracy
-   This is how economic liberalism led to fascism

## Polanyi's Warning

-   The self-regulating market is a "dangerous fantasy"
-   Commodifying labor, land, and money destroys society
-   Society will always protect itself (double movement)
-   If democratic protection is blocked, society turns to authoritarianism
-   Market regulation is not "leftist" but necessary for social survival

## Small Groups: Evaluating Polanyi 

**Question 1: How free should markets be?**
-   Does Polanyi prove that self-regulating markets are impossible/dangerous?
-   What are the **strengths** of his argument? What evidence supports it?
-   What are the **weaknesses**? What might critics say?

**Question 2: Do free markets lead to populism/fascism?**
-   Is Polanyi right that economic liberalism caused fascism?
-   What other factors might explain the rise of fascism in the 1930s?
-   Does this argument apply to today's populist movements?
