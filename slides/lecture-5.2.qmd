# Public Goods

## What is a Public Good? 

<br>

- **Non-excludable:** can’t restrict use once provided  
- **Non-rival (jointly supplied):** once available, can be consumed by others at no additional cost
- Opposite of a private good, distinct from “club goods” and “common pool resources”

## Examples

![](images/examples.png){fig-align="center"}

## Relevance 

<br>

- Public goods associated with programmatic politics
- Clientelism associated with club goods and private benefits

## Geography of Clientelism

<br>

```{r}
#| label: clientelism-map

map <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf") %>%
  left_join(
    clientelism,
    by = "iso_a3_eh"
  ) %>%
  filter(iso_a3_eh != "ATA") %>% # remove Antarctica
  ggplot(aes(fill = clientelism)) + # you get country label last if you put it here
  geom_sf() + # or here
  aes(label = country) + # you only get country label first if you put it here
  scale_fill_viridis_c(direction = -1) +
  theme(legend.position="right") +
  labs(
    title = paste("V-Dem Clientelism Index", latest_year),
    fill = NULL,
    caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute, Varieties of Democracy Dataset" 
  )

plotly_map <- ggplotly(map, tooltip = c("country", "clientelism")) %>% 
  style(hoveron = "fill")  %>%
  # adjust width and height
  layout(width = 900, height = 450) %>%
  # add source
  layout(annotations = list(text = "Source: The V-Dem Institute, Varities of Democracy Dataset",  
                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = 1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) %>%
  # add web address
  layout(annotations = list(text = "www.psc2339.com", 
                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,
                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,
                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))

  style = "width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;",

)
```

::: notes
- On the whole SE Asia is pretty clientelistic, but there are some bright spots
in terms of social programs. 
- Lets take a moment to explore some of these.

# Vote Buying in Indonesia 

## Discussion

<br>

- What is a "success team"?
- How does clientelism in Indonesia differ from clientelism in Latin America?
  - What changed in 1999?
- What is a "ground war" and how is it fought? 
- What does "margin error" refer to?
- When is vote buying successful? What does it achieve?

# Electoral Systems

## Closed and Open-list PR

- PR versus SMD
- Closed-list PR (most systems)
	- Party controls who is on list, and ranking of candidates
	- Generates loyalty to party
- Open-list PR (Indonesia)
	- Vote for individuals not parties
	- Candidates with most votes get seats

## Ballot Example

![2014 DPR (People's Representative Council) ballot for Bali. One punch for party and one for a candidate](images/ballot1.jpg)

## Election Results

# Brokers 

## Tim Sukses

- "Success teams"
- Important due to general weakness of parties
- Hierarchical, pyramid-like structures 
- Brokers are notoriously unreliable
	- Predation, defection, duplicity

## Effectiveness	

- Base areas 
  - *Tim sukses*, vote buying more effective 
  - But required to stay relevant 
- In non-base areas
  - Community gifts and become more important
  - Success depends on influence of community leaders 
  - Quid pro quo is expected but difficult to enforce

## Comparisons

- Argentina
- India
  - North vs. South
- Sub-Saharan Africa
  - Similar variation
- Hypothesis: clientelism is stronger where parties are weaker

# Exercise

- [Bobby Nasution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Nasution) is running for governor of North Sumatra.
- You are his *tim sukses* (success team). How will you...
  - Manage brokers?
  - Decide where to focus your resources?
  - Choose what *types* of gifts to give (individual vs. community)?
  - Minimize "margin error"
  - Prevent rivals from poaching your resources?

# Welfare States in SE Asia

## Welfare States in Developing Countries

- Noncontributory social assistance
	- Direct transfers, frequently conditional
- Social insurance
	- Protection against loss of employment
- Health care schemes
- Labor market policies
	- Minimum wage, terms and conditions of work, resolution of industrial disputes, etc.
- Education spending

## Southeast Asia Examples 

<br>

- Malaysia
  - [Universal healthcare](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/5/e047126) alongside private system
  - Free primary and junior secondary education
- Thailand
  - ["30-bhat scheme"](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/thailand-gave-healthcare-to-its-entire-population-and-the-results-were-dramatic/)
  - Free education through secondary school

## 

<br>

- Indonesia 
  - [Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)](https://staff.ui.ac.id/system/files/users/pratiwi.sudarmono/publication/pratiwiunivesallancet2018.pdf)
  - Universal healthcare scheme introduced in 2014
  - Covers > 200 million people, largest single payer scheme in the world (Augustina et. al. 2019)
