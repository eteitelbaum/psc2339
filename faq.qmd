## I am having trouble accessing the course readings. What should I do?

Please be sure that you are logged into
[Gelman](https://library.gwu.edu/) when trying to access the course readings. Most of the readings links will take you directly to the login page if you are not already logged in. But some of them require you to be logged in ahead of time. To log in to Gelman, click on the green "My Account" icon on the Gelman homepage.
