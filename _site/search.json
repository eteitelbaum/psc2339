    "text": "Steps\nThe goal of this first assignment is to lay the groundwork for your research. You’ll identify a topic, formulate a preliminary research question and thesis, gather scholarly sources, and begin thinking about what data can help you make your case.\n\nChoose a topic. Look through the syllabus and identify a topic that interests you. It should be specific enough to explore in depth but broad enough that there’s existing scholarship and available data.\nDevelop a research question and preliminary thesis. Your research question should be something genuinely debatable—not just a descriptive question like “How has inequality changed?” but rather something like “Does trade liberalization increase or decrease income inequality in developing countries?” Your preliminary thesis is your tentative answer to that question. It’s okay if this evolves as you do more research, but you need a working argument to guide your initial work.\nFind a dataset to work with. Your argument will need empirical support, so identify a dataset that can provide evidence for or against your thesis. The dataset should include both cross-sectional (across countries or regions) and time-series (over time) components.\nGather sources and create an annotated bibliography using Zotero. You’ll need to ground your argument in existing scholarship. Start by identifying relevant course readings, then branch out to find additional academic sources. You should have at least 8-10 sources for this assignment. Set up a Zotero library for this project (if you haven’t used Zotero before, see the resources below) and create an annotated bibliography where you briefly summarize each source and explain its relevance to your argument.\nWrite a research proposal outline. This will be a brief (2-3 page) document that sketches out your planned argument, explains why it matters, and describes how you’ll use data to support your thesis.",

    "section": "What to Submit",
    "text": "What to Submit\nYou will submit a research proposal (2-3 pages) along with an annotated bibliography. Your proposal should be written in clear, engaging prose—this is an opportunity to convince someone that your research question matters and that you have a compelling argument to make. The proposal should include the following elements:\n1) Introduction and Research Question (approximately 150-200 words)\nStart by introducing your topic. Why does it matter? What makes it interesting or important? Then present your specific research question clearly. This should be a question that can be answered with empirical evidence and logical argument, not just description.\n2) Preliminary Thesis Statement\nState your argument clearly and concisely. This is your answer to the research question. What do you expect to find? What claim will you defend? Remember that a good thesis is specific, debatable, and grounded in evidence. For example: “I argue that democratic institutions mediate the relationship between trade openness and inequality, such that trade liberalization increases inequality in autocracies but not in democracies.”\n3) Background and Context (approximately 300-400 words)\nProvide the necessary background information to understand your research question. What do we already know about this topic from the course readings and your preliminary research? What debates exist in the literature? This is where you begin to situate your argument in relation to existing scholarship.\nYou should also acknowledge the complexity of your topic. Are there important counterarguments or alternative explanations you’ll need to address? Briefly note these—you don’t need to fully engage with them yet, but show that you’re aware of the intellectual landscape.\n4) Proposed Data and Analysis (approximately 300-400 words)\nDescribe the dataset you plan to use. Where does it come from? What time period and countries/regions does it cover? What are the key variables you’ll analyze?\nThen explain how you plan to use this data to support your argument. What kind of visualizations will you create? You should plan to include at least four data visualizations in your final paper. For this proposal, describe what these might be and explain what each visualization would demonstrate. For example: “A scatter plot showing the relationship between trade openness and the Gini coefficient across 120 countries would allow me to test whether increased trade correlates with higher inequality. A line chart tracking these variables over time in selected case study countries would reveal whether this relationship holds within countries as well as across them.”\nBe specific about what will be on the x and y axes of your charts, what time periods you’ll focus on, and how each visualization serves your argument. The data should provide evidence for your major claims, not just decoration.\n5) Annotated Bibliography\nUsing Zotero (or another citation management system), create an annotated bibliography with at least 8-10 sources. At least 4-5 of these should be course readings relevant to your topic, and the rest should be additional academic sources (journal articles, books, or reports from reputable organizations like the World Bank, IMF, or OECD).\nFor each source, provide the full citation in a consistent format (APA, Chicago, or MLA—be consistent) followed by a 2-3 sentence annotation that summarizes the main argument or findings and explains how this source relates to your research. For example:\n\nRodrik, Dani. 1997. “Has Globalization Gone Too Far?” California Management Review 39(3): 29-53.\nRodrik argues that increased economic integration can exacerbate domestic social conflicts and inequalities, particularly in countries with weak safety nets. This article provides theoretical grounding for my argument about the differential effects of trade liberalization depending on domestic institutions.",

    "text": "Steps\n1. Revise and polish your draft based on feedback\nTake the feedback you received on Assignment 2 seriously. Where was your argument unclear? Where did you need more evidence? Where did the logic break down? Use this feedback to strengthen your paper.\nYou may also find that your thinking has evolved since Assignment 2. That’s good! Don’t be afraid to refine your thesis or adjust your argument if your analysis has led you to new insights. Just make sure that your final paper presents a coherent, well-supported argument.\n2. Complete your data analysis and finalize your visualizations\nBy now you should have a clear sense of what your data shows. Create at least four polished visualizations that provide evidence for your argument. These might include line charts showing trends over time, scatter plots revealing relationships between variables, bar charts comparing countries or regions, maps displaying geographic patterns, or other visualization types appropriate to your research question.\nEach visualization should be clearly labeled with titles, axis labels, legends, and—crucially—figure numbers and captions that explain what the visualization shows and why it matters. The visualizations should be integrated into your paper at the appropriate points in your argument, not just dumped in an appendix.\n3. Write a complete, well-structured paper\nYour final paper should tell a coherent story from beginning to end. The introduction should hook the reader and establish why your question matters. The literature review should set up your argument by showing what we already know and what gaps remain. Your theoretical framework should explain the logic of your argument. Your data analysis should provide empirical evidence. And your conclusion should reflect on what you’ve learned, what questions remain, and what the implications of your findings are.\nThroughout the paper, make sure every major claim is supported by evidence. When you make an empirical claim, back it up with data. When you make a theoretical claim, provide reasoning and cite relevant scholarship. When you acknowledge counterarguments or limitations, explain how they affect (or don’t affect) your overall argument.\n4. Ensure proper citation throughout using Zotero\nBy this point you should have a substantial bibliography—likely 15-20 sources or more. Make sure every source you cite in the text appears in your references, and vice versa. Use Zotero to generate your bibliography in a consistent format (APA, Chicago, or MLA). Check that all citations are complete and properly formatted.\n5. Proofread carefully\nDon’t let typos and grammatical errors undermine your hard work. Read through your paper carefully, ideally more than once. Better yet, have someone else read it too. Does your argument flow logically? Are there awkward transitions? Are your visualizations clearly integrated into the text?",

The paper should be 12-15 pages of main text (not counting title page, references, or any appendices), double-spaced, in a standard 12-point font. It should include the following sections:\n1. Title Page\nInclude your title, your name, the course information, and the date. If you’re writing a policy memo or report, format the title page appropriately for that genre.\n2. Abstract (approximately 150-200 words)\nProvide a concise summary of your research question, argument, methods, and main findings. Someone should be able to read your abstract and understand what your paper is about and what you conclude.\n3. Introduction (approximately 2-3 pages)\nHook the reader with an engaging opening that establishes why your topic matters. Present your research question clearly. State your thesis prominently—what is your main argument? Provide a roadmap for the rest of the paper, briefly outlining what each section will do.\n4. Literature Review (approximately 3-4 pages)\nSynthesize the existing scholarship on your topic. Organize this thematically or by argument, not source-by-source. Show how different scholars approach your question and where debates exist. Most importantly, position your own argument in relation to this literature. How does your thesis build on, challenge, or refine existing work?\n5. Theoretical Framework (approximately 1.5-2 pages)\nExplain the logic of your argument. What is the causal mechanism or theoretical reasoning that leads you to expect the patterns you predict? Why should your thesis be true? This section provides the conceptual foundation for your empirical analysis.\n6. Counterarguments and Alternative Explanations (approximately 1-1.5 pages)\nEngage seriously with potential objections to your argument. What are the main alternative explanations for the patterns you’re studying? What evidence might challenge your thesis? How do you respond to these concerns? Strong papers don’t ignore their weaknesses—they address them directly and honestly.\n7. Data and Methods (approximately 1.5-2 pages)\nDescribe your dataset, variables, and analytical approach. Where does your data come from? What are its strengths and limitations? How are key variables measured? What time period and countries does your analysis cover? Be transparent about data quality issues or measurement challenges.\n8. Analysis and Findings (approximately 3-4 pages)\nThis is where you present your empirical evidence. Integrate your data visualizations into this section, using them to support specific claims. Each visualization should have a figure number and caption, and should be referenced in the text (“As Figure 1 shows…”).\nWalk the reader through what your data reveals. What patterns do you observe? How do these patterns support (or complicate) your thesis? Be honest about unexpected findings or puzzles in the data. Connect your empirical findings back to your theoretical argument throughout.\nYou should include at least four visualizations, but the exact number should be determined by what your argument needs. Don’t include a visualization just to hit a quota—include visualizations that actually illuminate important patterns.\n9. Discussion (approximately 1-2 pages)\nStep back from the specific findings and reflect on what they mean. How do your results contribute to the broader debates you discussed in the literature review? What are the implications for theory, policy, or future research? Are there important limitations to your findings that readers should keep in mind?\n10. Conclusion (approximately 1 page)\nSummarize your argument and main findings. What have we learned? What questions remain unanswered? Where might future research go from here? End with some reflections on the broader significance of your work.\n11. References\nInclude a complete bibliography of all sources cited in your paper, formatted consistently using Zotero. You should have at least 15-20 sources, with a good mix of course readings and additional scholarship.",

You can choose any indicator besides life expectancy (which was used in the instructional video).\nAfter opening the file in Excel, have a look at the data. Make sure that there are not too many observations and that the file includes numbers and not text, e.g. “1,000,000” as opposed to “1M.” If there are problems with the data, try a different indicator. Make sure that there are years across the top row and country names in the columns. Think about what units the data are in., e.g. thousands of dollars, millions of people, etc. so that you have a sense of what you are working with. Look for some basic trends and patterns in the data and see if they make sense to you.\nIf the data look good, create a new worksheet. Name it something like “analysis.”\nIn the new worksheet, choose four years to analyze that are roughly evenly spaced across the time period covered by the data. Follow the example in the video to calculate the following values: minimum, median, mean, and maximum. Next, choose a value that seems like an interesting threshold to explore. Count the number and percentage of countries above above that threshold. Put the information in a table like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear \\(X\\)\nYear \\(Y\\)\nYear \\(Z\\)\nYear \\(Q\\)\n\n\n\n\nMinimum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. &gt; \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n% &gt; \\(x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify an interesting twenty-year period to analyze for three countries.

    "text": "This is a survey course in comparative political economy, a field of inquiry within the subfield of comparative politics that explores the interaction of politics and the economy. Comparative political economy is one of the most active research fields in comparative politics and is comprised of a wide range of research topics. Frequently the focus of research in comparative political economy is on how institutions influence economic outcomes. How, for example, do property rights facilitate investment and economic growth? How do different colonial legacies inhibit or promote economic performance? Sometimes, however, institutions become the dependent variable in our analysis. How does wealth influence regime stability? Or how does economic globalization affect welfare states? This course will address questions like these through an exploration of relevant literature. The syllabus emphasizes current research agendas in political economy, and its main goal is to provide students with a broad overview of contemporary debates in the field.",

Follow the steps in the bar chart video to create a bar chart comparing those countries. Save your file.\nUsing those same countries, follow the steps in the line chart video to create a line chart for your countries. Save the file with your newly created line chart.\nNow select all countries and one other indicator to compare your indicator with. This should be something that you think is related to your indicator, e.g. would display a positive or negative correlation with your indicator. Follow the steps in the scatter plot video to create a scatter plot for your indicator and the other variable you have chosen. Save your file with the new scatter plot visualization.\nNow follow the steps in the map video to create a map visualization for your indicator. Save the file with the visualization.\nCopy the four visualizations that you have made from the Excel files and paste them into a Word file. Make sure that each visualization has an appropriate title. Now below each visualization include a source note and write a line or two describing what you see in the visualization (e.g. trends, comparisons relationships).\nSave the Word file, convert it to a .pdf, and upload it to Blackboard.

    "section": "Steps",
    "text": "Steps\nThis assignment has both intellectual and practical components. You need to develop your argument through engagement with the literature while also doing the technical work of data preparation.\n1. Expand and deepen your literature review\nGo beyond the annotated bibliography you created for Assignment 1. Read your sources carefully and identify the main debates, theoretical frameworks, and empirical findings. How do different scholars approach your topic? Where do they agree and disagree? What gaps exist in the literature that your research might address?\nAs you write your literature review, don’t just summarize each source one by one. Instead, organize the literature thematically or by argument. Show how different scholars are in conversation with each other, and position your own argument in relation to these debates.\n2. Refine your thesis and engage with counterarguments\nBased on your deeper engagement with the literature and your preliminary look at the data, you may need to refine or adjust your thesis. That’s normal and good—it shows you’re thinking carefully about your topic.\nIdentify the main counterarguments or alternative explanations to your thesis. Who would disagree with you and why? What evidence might challenge your argument? You don’t need to fully resolve these tensions yet, but you should demonstrate awareness of them and begin thinking about how you’ll address them in your final paper.\n3. Download and clean your data\nNow it’s time to get your hands dirty with the actual data. Download the dataset you identified in Assignment 1 and open it in Excel’s Power Query Editor (or another tool if you prefer) to see what you’re working with.\nAsk yourself these questions: - Are the data in long format or will you need to reshape them? - How many years are there in the data and what will you need to filter out? - Which variables are most relevant to your argument? - Are there missing values or data quality issues you need to address?\nFollow the steps we discussed in class to clean the data and prepare it for analysis. If you’re working with more than one dataset, you’ll need to merge them—particularly if you want to examine relationships between variables from different sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI recommend working with just a handful of variables for this assignment. Focus on the 3-5 variables that are most essential to your argument. You can always add more later if needed, but it’s better to do a thorough job with a few key variables than to spread yourself too thin.\n\n\n4. Create preliminary visualizations\nUsing the tools we’ve learned in class—Excel, Power BI, R, or whatever you’re most comfortable with—create 2-3 preliminary data visualizations. These don’t need to be polished or publication-ready yet, but they should be clear enough to give you (and me) a sense of what patterns exist in your data.\nThink about what story each visualization tells and how it relates to your argument. Does it provide evidence for your thesis? Does it reveal complexities or exceptions you’ll need to address?",

    "section": "What to Submit",
    "text": "What to Submit\nYou will submit a draft of your research paper (6-8 pages, not including references or appendices) along with your cleaned dataset and preliminary visualizations. This draft should include the following sections:\n1. Introduction (approximately 1-1.5 pages)\nYour introduction should draw the reader in and establish why your research question matters. Present your research question clearly and state your thesis. This should be more polished and compelling than your initial proposal—you’ve done more reading and thinking by now, so your argument should be sharper and more sophisticated.\n2. Literature Review (approximately 2-3 pages)\nThis is the heart of this assignment. Your literature review should synthesize existing scholarship on your topic, organizing it thematically or by argument rather than simply summarizing each source. Identify the main debates and theoretical frameworks scholars use to understand your topic. Where do scholars agree? Where do they disagree?\nCrucially, your literature review should set up your own argument. Show where there are gaps in the literature, unresolved questions, or new contexts that merit further investigation. Position your thesis in relation to this existing scholarship. How does your argument build on, challenge, or refine what others have found?\n3. Theoretical Framework and Counterarguments (approximately 1-1.5 pages)\nLay out the logic of your argument more fully. What is the causal mechanism or theoretical reasoning that supports your thesis? Why should we expect to see the pattern you predict?\nThis is also where you should engage seriously with counterarguments. What are the main alternative explanations for the patterns you’re studying? What evidence might challenge your thesis? Be honest about the limitations and complexities. Strong arguments acknowledge their weaknesses and explain how they’ll address them—they don’t pretend those weaknesses don’t exist.\n4. Data and Methods (approximately 1.5-2 pages)\nDescribe your dataset in detail. Where does it come from? What time period and countries does it cover? How reliable is it? If there are known limitations or measurement issues, acknowledge them.\nDescribe the key variables you’re analyzing and explain how they’re measured. Then discuss your planned visualizations and analyses. You should plan to create at least four visualizations for your final paper. For this draft, describe what these will be and explain what each will demonstrate. Be specific: What will be on each axis? What countries or time periods will you focus on? How will each visualization provide evidence for your argument?\nIf you’ve already created 2-3 preliminary visualizations (as recommended), describe what they show and what you learned from creating them. Include these visualizations in an appendix.\nAlso use this section to be honest about any challenges you encountered in preparing the data. Did you discover data quality issues? Are there missing values that concern you? Are there limitations in the dataset that might affect your ability to test your argument? It’s much better to identify these issues now and think about how to address them than to discover them at the last minute.\n5. Brief Conclusion (approximately 1/2 page)\nWrap up this draft by summarizing where you are in your research process. What are your next steps? What additional analysis do you need to do? What parts of your argument need further development?\n6. References\nInclude a complete reference list using Zotero (or your chosen citation management system). You should have expanded your bibliography beyond Assignment 1—aim for at least 12-15 sources, with a good mix of course readings and additional scholarship. Use a consistent citation format throughout (APA, Chicago, or MLA).\n7. Appendices\nInclude your cleaned dataset as a .csv or Excel file. Also include any preliminary visualizations you’ve created, with brief captions explaining what each shows.",

Furthermore, the violation will be reported to GW’s Office of Academic Integrity, which can impose additional penalties beyond those I may impose.\n\n\nReligious holidays\nStudents must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see “Religious Holidays.”\n\n\nUse of electronic materials and class recordings\nStudents are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct.\nPlease contact the instructor if you have questions regarding whatconstitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions.\nPlease contact Disability Support Services if you have questions or need assistance in accessing electronic course materials.",
