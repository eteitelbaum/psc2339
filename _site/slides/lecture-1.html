<h2>The “Invisible Hand”</h2>
<ul>
<li>19th century economic liberalism
<ul>
<li>Ricardo/Smith</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An economy directed by market prices and nothing but market prices</li>
<li>Polanyi calls it a “dangerous fantasy”</li>
<li>Tremendous amount of bureaucracy/governance required to maintain free markets</li>
</ul>

<section id="state-of-nature-i" class="slide level2">
<h2>State of Nature I</h2>
<ul>
<li>For Smith, our nature is to “truck, barter and trade”</li>
<li>For Polanyi, we are communal by nature</li>
<li>Markets have always played some role in society but not the dominant role</li>
<li>Importance of ethnography
<ul>
<li>Evidence-based approach</li>
<li>Not just a rhetorical device</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="state-of-nature-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2>State of Nature II</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trobriand Islanders (Papua New Guinea)</li>
<li>People motivated by status more than money
<ul>
<li>Money is a means to and end</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Money not that relevant for distribution

<li>Redistribution</li>
<li>Householding</li>
